Track.ME is gonna be an android application, which allows you to easily track yourself with the help of Google Maps.
There are other apps that do this aswell, but the focus on this one should be to save all the data on the mobile device itself and send as less information as possible to the internet.

It's intentional purpose was to be used as a tracker for runners, so therefore it should feature some statistics aswell.
